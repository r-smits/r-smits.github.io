	<p>See below links to side-projects showcasing what I have learnt since I started to learn how to code.

	Algochart
	This projects aims to use simple mathematical concepts and javascript to avoid using existing libraries as much as possible.
	I have coded everything on the page without libraries on purpose, because I believe it is a good way to champion a quick learning curve.
	Algochart was born in an attempt to visualise various sorting algorithms and is currenlty a work in progress.</p>
