	<p><strong>Portfolio - r-smits (23/10/2019 2019)</strong>
	<br>
	<br>See below links to side-projects showcasing what I have learnt since I started to learn how to code. 
	<br>
	<br><strong>1.	Algochart - </strong><a href="algochart.html">Algochart v. 0.01</a></p>
	</p>This projects aims to use simple mathematical concepts and javascript to avoid using existing libraries as much as possible.
	I have coded everything on the page without any external libraries because I believe it is a good way to champion new challenges and learn as much as possible in the process.
	Algochart was born in an attempt to visualise various sorting algorithms and is a work in progress.</p>
